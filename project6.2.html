                <p>Project Description: Making a book cover is a pretty cool process, but it takes a lot of steps to get it right. First off, I had to find a title that fit with the theme I wanted. I went to ChatGPT and found the title - "The Haunting of Ravenwood Manor." Then, I had to find a picture that matched the book's vibe. I went to FireFly, and finally found an image that fit the spooky and creepy theme of the book. I downloaded it and opened it up in Photoshop. After that, I added the title, author name, and subtitle to the image. I picked a font that was easy to read but also matched the mood of the book. Once I got everything looking just right, I saved it and turned it in.</p>
