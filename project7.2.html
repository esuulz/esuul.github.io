                <p>Project Description: To bring my animation of a bunny dancing, hopping, and running around on the grass to life, I had to go to Adobe Stocks for images of a bunny and a grassy background. Selecting the ones that aligned with my vision, I exported them to animate, which served as my primary tool for the animation process. The next step was to create the bunny's movements, clip by clip. This proved to be a time-consuming process, as I had to pay close attention to detail to ensure that each movement was smooth and natural. Throughout the project, I found myself constantly tweaking and adjusting to perfect the bunny's every hop, skip, and jump. One of the biggest challenges I encountered was creating the bunny's fluid movements on the grass.</p>
