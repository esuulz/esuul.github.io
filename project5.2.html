                <p>Project Description:  I was given  four different video clips to choose from. After reviewing each of the options, I decided to work with clip 1. My task was to add sound to each clip, so I began by searching for suitable audio files on FreeSound. I spent some time listening to different sound effects and music tracks to find the perfect match for each clip. Once I had selected the sounds, I downloaded them and then imported both the audio files and the video into Premiere Pro. Using the software, I combined each clip with its corresponding sound file to create a cohesive and polished final product.</p>
