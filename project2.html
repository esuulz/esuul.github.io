                <p>Project Description: For the movie poster project , I began by reading the short story "Rules of the Game" by Amy Tan. After gaining a better understanding of the story, I went to Pintrest and spent some time browsing through various inspirational photos until I found some that I thought would be helpful for my project. I saved those pictures and then brought them to Illustrator, where I started working on my image. I had to spend some time experimenting with different ideas and techniques before I finally decided on the best way to bring my vision to life. It was a challenging but rewarding process that required a lot of patience and creativity.</p>
